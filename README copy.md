## 📝 Reflection

After completing this lab, write a few sentences about:
- What was the most challenging part?
- What did you learn about semantic HTML?
- How do you plan to expand this portfolio?


[Write your reflection here]
I think the most challenging part was not knowing what to put on the about me page. I didn't know if I needed to do it like a resume style or just random facts.
So much, like I feel like I have an actual understanding of HTML, I have a completley new understanidng that I didn't have before.
I want to make it a beautiful personal portfolio that I can show employers. I actually have something to present after all my years of school.
